**Description:** We reconcile the odd behavior of the different views of infall into the spherically symmetrically spacetime by studying the motion of light. We find that these spacetimes contain a surface beyond which communication is not possible—an “event horizon”—and therefore constitute black holes. This class focuses on the non-rotating Schwarzschild black hole; more general forms are known (the rotating Kerr solution being particularly important). Unfortunately, plans for more detailed discussion were disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic.

**Instructor:** Prof. Scott Hughes
