**Description:** Variants on the Riemann curvature tensor: the Ricci tensor and Ricci scalar, both obtained by taking traces of the Riemann curvature. The connection of curvature to tides; geodesic deviation. Finally, the Bianchi identity, an identity describing derivatives of the Riemann curvature.

**Instructor:** Prof. Scott Hughes
