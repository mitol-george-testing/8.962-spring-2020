**Description:** The notion of “coordinate” bases. Several important 4-vectors for physics: 4-velocity, 4-momentum, 4-acceleration, and their properties. 1-forms, and tensors more generally. Using the metric and its inverse to raise and lower tensor indices. Introduction to tensor fields. The number flux 4-vector, and its use in defining a conservation law.

**Instructor:** Prof. Scott Hughes
